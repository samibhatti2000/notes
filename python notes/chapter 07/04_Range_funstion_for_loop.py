for i in range(8): #it wiil only count 7 nymber in range(8)
    print(i)

#if you want start range() from 1 do it range(1,8)

print("\n")

# for i in range(1,8):#if you want start range() from 1 do it range(1,8
#     print(i)
# for i in range(2,8):#if you want start range() from 2 do it range(2,8)
#     print(i)
# for i in range(3,8):#if you want start range() from 1 do it range(3,8)
#     print(i)

# for i in range(1,8,2):#if you want get step in number sequnce third option after comma,)
